# R_EDA_GRE- 1300 Most commonly used words

## Project Portfolio Exploratory Data Analysis

Before doing further statistical analysis or creating predictive modeling, usually a data scientist will first focus on EDA. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial stage of data analysis. The goal is for a data scientist to understand the characteristics, structure, and important components of a dataset, before processing it in a more complex manner.

I used a dataset titled “GRE-1300 Most Frequently Used Words” from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bakingbrainn/gre-1300-most-commonly-used-words).  This data was used to develop a machine learning model to determine the difficulty level of certain GRE words. All these words were taken from the vocabulary website. This data was collected using Beautiful Soup (BS4) and Selenium via Chrome WebDriver.

For the uninitiated, the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a form of standardized test to measure the academic ability and readiness of participants to continue their studies into graduate programs and business schools at various universities around the world.

The analysis of scraping results is very important because it is one of the necessary materials for the development of machine models in the academic world. My analysis is based on a data set of scraping results in 2025.

Goals :
1. Frequency and usage rate of each word are inversely proportional
2. Frequency by word
3. Meaning of each word

Insights:
1. The higher the frequency, the less frequently the word is used and vice versa.
2. Frequency by word: 'analgesia' has the highest frequency, and 'note' has the lowest frequency.
3. Word and Meaning are closely related, while frequency must be transposed in reverse order.
